                </li>
                <li>
                    Information about your data uploads to The Service or data retrievals from The Service
                    <ul>
                        <li>Including public keys provided by you for encryption purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How do we collect your data?</h3>
            <p>You directly provide The Service with most of the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign in with "Elixir Login" button.</li>
                <li>Perform a dataset submission to the archive.</li>
                <li>Perform a dataset retrieval from the archive after access approval by the respective Data Access Committee.</li>
                <li>Voluntarily complete a customer survey or provide feedback on any of our message boards or via email.</li>
                <li>Use or view our website via your browser’s cookies.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How will we use your data?</h3>
            <p>The Service collects your data so that we can:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Facilitate the authentication and authorization to The Service.
                    Since the authentication and authorization to The Service is based on Elixir AAI,
                    we need to store your Elixir ID, in order to keep you logged in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep track of which submission was performed by which user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Security and audit purposes to track all data transfers of files under controlled access regime due to their sensitive content (human genome phenome information).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Service will share your data with our partner(s) in order to facilitate authentication and authorization functionality.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Elixir AAI</li>
                <li>USIT</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the authentication attempts are processed by Elixir AAI, they will have to know your Elixir ID.
                The way Elixir AAI handles Elixir IDs is a subject of their Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elixir ID also will be stored at the USIT premises in order to keep track of all performed data submissions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How do we store your data?</h3>
            <p>The Service stores your authentication data (session tokens) using the browser cookies mechanism. The information about the cookies and how The Service is using them is provided below.</p>
            <p>Elixir ID is also securely stored in the database at the USIT server. This information is stored permanently, but can be removed in accordance with the right to erasure, described below.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Elixir ID is stored as part of the logs of The Service at the USIT-hosted web server. This information is stored for maximum 6 months following The Service's logging policies, and also can be removed in accordance with the right to erasure, described below.</p>
            <p>As The Service depends on TSD for secure storage of deposited datasets to the archive, all dataset transfers in and out of The Service are also being logged and audited in the TSD infrastructure, as according to TSD Privacy Policy.</p>
            <br>
